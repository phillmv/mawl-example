# mawl-example

This [repo](https://github.com/phillmv/mawl-example) is meant to showcase the [mawl github action](https://github.com/phillmv/mawl).

When when fed simple, honest markdown files, mawl [generates a static website](https://phillmv.github.io/mawl-example) hosted on GitHub Pages.

Mawl is a front end for Arquivo. Arquivo is a tool for archiving your notes & publishing your research. For more information, see the [arquivo repository](https://github.com/phillmv/arquivo).

Oh! I almost forgot to mention. You can use stuff like #tags for linking pages together.
